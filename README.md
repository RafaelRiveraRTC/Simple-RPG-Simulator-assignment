# Simple RPG Simulator assignment

My goal for this project is to make a working drop down menu,a textbox and 2 buttons, one theat submits the name and the selected character class to the richtextbox

the second button will calculate the total attack power of each of the characters spawned in accordingly

First thing i needed to do was to make my labels, my comboBox,my single text box and RichTextBox and my 2 buttons all inside my main window.

Next i needed to give each of them names so i can refrence them at a later time.

for the comboBox i need to make the values that will be selected from the combo box. I have chosen the 14 current classes of dnd 5th edition.  With the name of the combobox followed by .Item and .Add 

i am able to place the mentioned items inside the combo box where they can be accessed at a later time



what i want to attempt to get done if i have the time, 3 more combo boxes one for levels,one for races,

and finally one that changes subclass depending

on the base class that is selected.

Also i wish to add instances of random number generators so the stats and base health are randomly assigned
